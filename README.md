## Description

This is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Once opened, the user is presented with the home page that features two buttons, one to start the quiz and the other to view current scores. One the start button is clicked, the timer starts and one question is presented. Once answered, another question is presented, and so on. If the answers are correct, or wrong, a "correct!" or a "Wrong!" response will be shown underneath each question. Also, if the choice is wrong, the timer will be decreased by 10 seconds. Once the last question is answered, the user is presented with a box that requires their initials to save their scores. Once their response is submitted, the score list will be presented with the highest scores being displayed on top. The score rows will display the user's initials, time spent, and score. At this point, the user can either press the clear button to clear all scores or the save and retiurn button that saves resutls and transfers user back to the main page. Note that this app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
